GameChanger Cloud remains a work in progress, contributors are more than welcome. You can contribute to the following projects or suggest improvements through our [contact form](/contact/). 

The next steps for GameChanger would be to :
*  Conceive a fourth client side generator, which would be based on an Angular schematic for the generation of the files and Vue.js as the front-end framework  
*  Change the projects based on yeoman so that they would instead use an Angular schematic  
*  Work on the generator based on Ember to bring it up to date 
*  Update the front-end and back-end generators so that would function with geographical and custom scalars
*  Support incremental generation
